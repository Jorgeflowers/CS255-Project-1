# CS255-Project-1

The DriverPass project focused on designing a system to help students schedule driving lessons, take online practice exams, and track their progress. The client, DriverPass, wanted a web-based platform that would improve training accessibility and increase student success rates on the DMV test.

For Project One, I developed the Business Requirements Document (BRD), which outlined the system’s objectives, user roles, functional and nonfunctional requirements, and platform constraints. This document served as the foundation for system design by ensuring that the solution met the client’s needs. I particularly excelled in defining clear functional requirements, such as lesson scheduling, user authentication, and progress tracking. These ensured the system would perform essential tasks smoothly. If I were to revise one part, I would refine the assumptions and limitations section to account for potential challenges, such as handling cancellations or supporting additional languages.

For Project Two, I created the System Design Document (SDD), translating the BRD into a functional system design with UML diagrams. One of my key contributions was the Sequence Diagram for Scheduling a Lesson, which mapped out interactions between users, the system, the database, and the payment processor. This diagram ensured that the scheduling process was well-structured and secure.

Understanding user needs was critical throughout both projects. The BRD helped define what the system should achieve, while the SDD detailed how it would function. By prioritizing usability, security, and efficiency, I ensured that the system design aligned with real-world user expectations.

Moving forward, I plan to enhance my system analysis and design skills by refining requirement gathering techniques and incorporating iterative design improvements based on user feedback. Using structured methodologies like UML, Gantt charts, and prototyping, I can continue developing user-friendly, scalable systems.
